    "AboutText": "Saturday, June 23rd 2:46pm Qijin Beach Ready for some summer Ultimate action on the beach? Come out to Qijin with a couple of friends and let's get some quality games in. The tournament format will get you a ton of different team matchups, and all you need is to form a squad of 3 (including yourself) to join: 1 (C)urious player: Never played Ultimate before but interested/willing to give it a shot 1 (A)mateur player: Played a bit but just getting a feel for the game 1 (P)roficient player: Someone who has some skills knowledge to share! Finally, each squad should have at least 1 female (any skill level). Got a couple friends in mind? SQUAD fee (not per person): $1000 ($900 before June 8th Go! Go! Go!) That's for 3 people What that gets you: - An afternoon of Ultimate - A reversible tanktop - Prizes - Water and Ice Individual fee: $350 (You'll be refunded if we can't get you placed on a team :/ ) Extra Details (feel free to skip if too confusing.. Most important thing is that you understand the parts above!): The goal of this tournament is introduce the sport to as many people as possible while playing with as many different people as possible. With that in mind we're introducing a new kind of tournament where you will be teaming up with other squads in each game of 5v5 ultimate. Here's an example: Your squad (of 3) plays with Bob's and Marla's squad VS Steve's, John's and Debbie's squad. - The squads of the winning team each get a point Your squad then plays with Michael's squad and Victoria's squad VS 3 random other squads - The squads of the winning team each get a point One more game with different squads We will see which squads tallied up the most points by the end of the tournament to declare a winner!",

    "AboutText": "夏天來了，你們準備好要來場沙灘飛盤了嗎！快和幾個朋友一起來旗津參加比賽吧。 這次的比賽形式會讓大家以不同的方式交替組隊，而你所需要做的只是組一個3人小隊（包括你自己）一起參加。 3人包含： 1個好奇寶寶：從來沒玩過競技飛盤，但有興趣及願意嘗試。 1個愛好者：已玩了一陣子競技飛盤，但對於比賽還似懂非懂。 1個菁英份子：有知識及技巧可以與大家分享的人。 最後，請注意每隊需至少有一位女性選手（不論程度） 已經知道要找哪幾個朋友一起參加了嗎？ 小隊參賽費用（非單人）：1000元（6/8前報名為900元，快開始召集吧） 而你會得到： - 整個下午的飛盤時光 - 可正反兩穿的無袖上衣 - 前幾名的獎品 - 水及冰塊 個人報名費用：350元（若我們沒辦法幫你找到可參加的隊伍，費用將全數退還） 額外細節（重點是你已瞭解上述訊息，以下若太複雜可略過）： 本次的活動目標一為推廣競技飛盤讓更多人認識，二為能和各個不同選手一起組隊。所以我們將介紹一個新型式的比賽，每隊每場都會與不同的小隊組隊，進行5:5的比賽。範例如下： - 你的小隊（3人）與其他兩小隊（Bob & Marla，各3人）組成一隊對上其他三小隊（Steve, John & Debbie)所組成的隊伍。贏的那一方，3小隊各得一分 - 你的小隊在下一場比賽與其他2小隊組隊，對上其他3小隊所組成的隊伍。贏的那一方，3小隊再各得一分 - 重複相同賽制 -在所有的比賽結束後，我們會結算個小隊的分數，得到最多分者為最後贏家",
